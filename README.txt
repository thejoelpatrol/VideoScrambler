This is a Processing program that causes a video to appear glitchy, sort as if packets/frames are being dropped, but not exactly. It's not intended for anything particularly serious, but just a cool effect for artists. 

I threw it together for fun a while back, and I'm going to clean it up so it would be usable by other people, but for now it's not very presentable.
