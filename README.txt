This is a Processing program that causes a video to appear glitchy, sort as if packets/frames are being dropped, but not exactly. It's not intended for anything particularly serious, but just a cool effect for artists. 

It works fine if you want to use it in Processing, but I've now created a better version that uses Processing within a regular Java program, which allows you to use graphical controls to change the program parameters while it's running. This is basically a whole new project, and it is here: https://github.com/thejoelpatrol/VideoScrambler-Java
